Project Overview:
The Sales Data Pipeline Project demonstrates a real-world data engineering pipeline built with Apache Spark and Delta Lake. This project simulates a typical ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, where raw sales data is ingested, cleaned, aggregated, and saved as both Delta Tables and CSV files for downstream analysis.
The pipeline showcases essential data transformation and data aggregation techniques required for handling structured data, focusing on scalability and real-time data processing.

Project Objectives:
ïƒ¼	Ingest raw sales data from a CSV file.
ïƒ¼	Clean and transform the data (convert string values to appropriate data types).
ïƒ¼	Perform aggregations to calculate total sales per product.
ïƒ¼	Save the cleaned and aggregated data as Delta Tables and CSV files for reporting.
ïƒ¼	Handle large-scale data processing using Apache Spark.

Technologies Used:
â€¢	Apache Spark (PySpark): For distributed data processing.
â€¢	Delta Lake: For handling Delta Tables and incremental data updates.
â€¢	Python: For scripting the ETL pipeline.
â€¢	Git: For version control.
â€¢	GitHub: For project hosting.

Data Transformation Process:
1.	Raw Data Ingestion:
o	The pipeline reads the raw sales.csv file containing sales records.

2.	Data Cleaning:
o	Converts string values (like Amount) to appropriate data types (e.g., float).
o	Filters out invalid or missing data.

3.	Aggregation:
o	Calculates the total sales per product and generates a summary dataset.
o	Saves the cleaned and aggregated data to both Delta Tables and CSV files.
